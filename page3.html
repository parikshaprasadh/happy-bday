    <h1>
        Happy Birthday Babyy!!!!
    </h1>
    <p>
        To be honest,I have no idea what to put here.<br>
        There is just a lot of space though.<br>
        So all I want to tell is have A very happy birthday and dont stop sending pics to me.<br>
        I love u sooo much with all my heart (and hopefully u do it to).<br>
        I wish u r happy everyday and grow successful (and let me eat ur head everyday).<br>
        Aste ig.... idk what else to type (insert crying emoji).<br>
        if u want to add smtg else for your own birthay wish, Here is a text box for that.<br>
        Do add more content to fill space. (Dw its not that i dont have content, its just hard to explain aste).<br>
        Love you soooooo much.
    </p></div>
    <div class = "img2"><input type="text" placeholder="Enter whatever you want to wish yourself instead of me" style = "background-color: transparent;"></div>
