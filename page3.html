    <h1>
        Happy Birthday Babyy!!!!
    </h1>
    <p>
        To be honest I have no idea what to put here.
        There is just a lot of space though.
        So all I want to tell is have A very happy birthday and dont stop sending pics to me.
        I love u sooo much with all my heart (and hopefully u do it to).
        I wish u r happy everyday and grow successful (and let me eat ur head everyday)
        Aste ig.... idk what else to type (insert crying emoji).
        if u want to add smtg else for your own birthay wish, Here is a text box for that.
        Do add more content to fill space. (Dw its not that i dont have content, its just hard to explain aste).
        Love you soooooo much.
        <input type="text" placeholder="Enter whatever you want to wish yourself instead of me" style = "background-color: transparent;">
    </p></div>
    <div class = "img2"></div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
